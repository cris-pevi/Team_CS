            <h2>Input Format</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Each test case consists of a single integer N - the number of candies.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Output Format</h2>
            <p>
                For each test case, output <strong>YES</strong>, if we can distribute all the candies between the three friends equally. Otherwise output <strong>NO</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can output each character of the answer in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings <strong>yEs, yes, Yes</strong>, and YES are considered the same.

            <h2>Constraints</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ≤ T ≤ 100</li>
                <li>0 ≤ N ≤ 100</li>
